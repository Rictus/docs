# Introduction

## KYVE

KYVE is a data storage framework that provides reliable and verified data. You can create your own storage pool and start storing your own data. In each pool, an uploader is responsible for storing the latest data. Validators inside that pool then make sure that the uploaded data is correct. In order to participate in storing or validating you need to stake KYVE tokens.

## Roles

When running a node, it can seamlessly switch between two main roles:

1. The **Uploader** uploads the new data onto Arweave
2. The **Validator** is responsible for verifying that the data uploaded is correct.
